# ðŸ§± Django Apps for a Fraud Detection System

A modular breakdown of Django apps needed to build a robust fraud detection software.

---

## 1. `users`

Handles authentication, user roles, and profile management.

**Features:**
- Custom user model (optional)
- Login / Registration / Password reset
- Email verification or 2FA
- User roles: Admin, Analyst, Auditor

---

## 2. `transactions`

Manages all user or system-generated transactions.

**Features:**
- Transaction model (amount, time, location, device, etc.)
- ForeignKey to `users`
- API to log and retrieve transactions
- Historical logs for auditing

---

## 3. `fraud_detection`

Core logic for analyzing transactions and predicting fraud.

**Features:**
- ML model loader and inference functions
- Rule-based detection system (optional)
- Store model outputs (e.g., `is_fraud`, `confidence_score`)
- API endpoint for prediction
- Scheduler for batch scoring (using Celery)

---

## 4. `alerts`

Handles notification and alerting when fraud is detected.

**Features:**
- Create and store alerts when high-risk activity is flagged
- Notification methods: Email, SMS, Dashboard
- Alert severity levels
- Admin resolution logs

---

## 5. `dashboard`

Admin/Analyst UI for monitoring fraud detection results.

**Features:**
- Real-time fraud monitoring
- Charts, stats, and summaries (use Plotly, Chart.js, or Django Admin + templates)
- Filter/search transactions
- Fraud case management (mark resolved, comments, etc.)

---

## 6. `logs` *(optional)*

Stores internal system events, predictions, and errors for audit and debugging.

**Features:**
- Logging API calls and predictions
- Track anomalies and failures
- Model versioning logs

---

## 7. `api` *(optional if you're exposing endpoints separately)*

A dedicated app for exposing RESTful endpoints (if not bundled inside each app).

**Features:**
- Versioned API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/...`)
- JWT or Token-based auth
- Rate limiting, CORS, etc.

---

## ðŸ›  Optional Third-Party Tools to Integrate

- **Celery** â€“ for asynchronous/batch prediction jobs
- **Redis/RabbitMQ** â€“ Celery broker
- **Django REST Framework** â€“ API layer
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ production-grade DB
- **Docker** â€“ deployment and reproducibility
- **Scikit-learn / joblib / ONNX** â€“ model loading
