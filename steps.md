# 🕵️ Fraud Detection Software Development Guide

A step-by-step roadmap to build a production-grade fraud detection system using Python and machine learning.

---

## 💡 Use Case Contexts

Fraud detection is useful in:

- 💳 Financial transactions (e.g., credit cards, forex)
- 🛍️ E-commerce (e.g., fake accounts, promo abuse)
- 🛡️ Insurance claims
- 🔐 Login/auth anomalies
- 📞 Telecom (SIM swaps, call fraud)

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Define the Problem

- What kind of fraud are you detecting?
- What’s the cost of false positives vs false negatives?
- Should detection be real-time or batch?

**Example:** Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

---

### 2. Collect and Understand Data

#### 📦 Data Types
- Transaction history: amount, time, location, method
- User data: age, address, behavioral patterns
- Device/browser/IP info
- Label: `fraudulent` or `legit` (for supervised ML)

#### 🛠 Tools
- CSVs, SQL, APIs
- ETL: Airflow, Prefect
- Storage: PostgreSQL, BigQuery

---

### 3. Data Preprocessing

#### 🔍 Clean & Engineer Features
- Convert timestamps into:
  - Time of day
  - Day of week
- Normalize amounts
- Encode categories (One-hot, Label Encoding)
- Derived features:
  - Distance from last location
  - Time since last transaction
  - Frequency of transactions

#### 🧰 Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

---

### 4. Choose the Detection Approach

#### 🧠 A. Supervised Learning (if labels exist)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree / Random Forest
- XGBoost / LightGBM
- Neural Networks

#### 🔍 B. Unsupervised Learning (no labels)
- K-Means, DBSCAN
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Autoencoders

**Note:** Use techniques to handle class imbalance:
- SMOTE
- Class weights
- Undersampling

---

### 5. Train and Evaluate the Model

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(class_weight='balanced')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
